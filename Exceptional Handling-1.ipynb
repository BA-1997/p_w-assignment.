    "## Ans:\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, an exception is raised. Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as attempting to divide by zero, trying to access an index that doesn't exist in a list, or opening a file that does not exist.\n",
